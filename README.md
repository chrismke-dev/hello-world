# hello-world
first repository for GitHub


Hello Friends,

I am Christian Fonseca and I am a new developer in Wisconsin and looking forward to creating new things on GitHub.
Any Mexican food is my favorite food! I want to become a developer for labor freedom and so tha I can travel the world and work remotely.
